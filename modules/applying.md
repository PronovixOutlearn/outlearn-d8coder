## Building a Drupal 8 Module: Blocks and Forms

What about having a form in a block? There is [example code](https://github.com/upchuk/d8-demo-modules/tree/master/demo) for that.

After that, we will create a simple form used to print out user submitted values to the screen" -->

## How to Build Multi-step Forms in Drupal 8

<!-- @link, "url" : "http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-multi-step-forms-in-drupal-8/", "text" : "I have seen that creating a base class for a common functionality is a good idea", "title" : "How to Build Multi-step Forms in Drupal 8", "description" : "We are going to look at building a multistep form in Drupal 8. For brevity, the form will have only two steps in the shape of two completely separate forms. To persist values across these steps, we will use functionality provided by Drupalâ€™s core for storing temporary and private data across multiple requests" -->

## Changing forms by `hook_form_alter()`

Form alteration has not changed too much since Drupal 7. You should add a `hook_form_alter()` implementation to your `.module` file, and the only difference in its signature is the same as with the form builder, validate and submit functions: the `$form_state` is no longer an array but a [`\Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface`](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21FormStateInterface.php/interface/FormStateInterface/8) object.

# Custom tables and displaying/saving data (basic Schema API)

It would be easier if we could use Views, at least for the listing part, wouldn't it? Well, that part is not yet done.

# Long-running tasks

## Batch API

<!-- @link, "url" : "https://github.com/boobaa/d7to8/blob/master/d8/d8batch/README.md", "text" : "I have learned that I don't have to learn the Batch API again", "title" : "D8 Batch API example", "description" : "This module is basically a demonstration of how can you import feed sources from a CSV file to Drupal" -->

## Queue API

Okay, we couldn't find the description of the code Daniel Sipos has published, but the example is great nonetheless. When a node is created as unpublished, it gets added to a queue. That queue can be processed in two ways: by submitting a form, which triggers running the `manual_node_publisher` worker, or by running cron, which triggers the `cron_node_publisher` worker. Both extend the [`NodePublishBase`](https://github.com/upchuk/d8-demo-modules/blob/master/npq/src/Plugin/QueueWorker/NodePublishBase.php) which is not recognized as a queue worker plugin since it does not have the required annotation. In the case of `cron_node_publisher` worker the runtime is limited to 10 seconds by its annonation.
