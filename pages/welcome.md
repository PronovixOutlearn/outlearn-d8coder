# Welcome!

Greetings! Welcome to Developing your first Drupal 8 modules!

We have put together this learning path for experienced Drupal 7 module developers, but developers not familiar with Drupal can also find it useful. As the new Drupal 8 has quite some novelties with regards to coding, some topics might look a bit strange if you have worked with Drupal 7 so far, but an experienced programmer should have no trouble keeping up.

The path includes content from a variety of sources. We have enhanced the learning experience to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points.

We'll start with a Drupal 8 Preview slideshow maintained by core committers for those who want to have a quick overview of the platform's latest release, and then we'll get right into the meat of module development, starting with the epic Hello World! module. At the end you will know how to dig up additional useful resources yourself, and we're inviting you to participate in maintaining this learning path with some possibly advanced topics in Drupal 8.


Good luck!
