-- Config management workflow

- Caching
- Node access
- Hooks, events and event subscribers
- Field API

-- Field types

- and possibly even more.

We hope you had fun and got a sense of what you can do with Drupal 8. If you can't wait to learn more, head out to [api.d.o](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/8) on our community's central site.
